How do I read a .txt file into R to make it analyzable?

ChatGPT said
Start by using read.table() for basic text file reading or read_delim() for a more robust approach:

R
Copy code
raw_data <- read.table("path_to_file.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
If you want better handling of delimiters and missing data, use readr:

R
Copy code
library(readr)
raw_data <- read_delim("path_to_file.txt", delim = "\t", na = "", trim_ws = TRUE)
Step 2: Handling Parsing Errors

User
I tried your code, but I only got 7,115 observations, even though my original file should have 17,504 rows.

ChatGPT said
The mismatch is likely caused by:

Irregular row lengths.
Embedded line breaks within fields.
Improper handling of delimiters or missing data.
To address this, let's:

Check the file for irregularities.
Force all rows to align with the correct number of columns.
Step 3: Checking for Irregular Rows

User: How do I check if there are irregular rows?

ChatGPT said
Use the following R code to identify rows with irregular numbers of fields:

R
Copy code
lines <- readLines("path_to_file.txt")
line_fields <- sapply(strsplit(lines, "\t"), length)
expected_fields <- max(line_fields)

# Identify irregular rows
irregular_rows <- which(line_fields != expected_fields)
if (length(irregular_rows) > 0) {
  writeLines(lines[irregular_rows], "irregular_lines.txt")
}
If no irregular rows are detected, the issue might be embedded line breaks or other formatting issues.

Step 4: Re-importing with Robust Parsing

User
There are no irregular rows. What do I do now?

ChatGPT said
Use read_delim() with enhanced settings to ensure all rows are read correctly:

R
Copy code
library(readr)

raw_data <- read_delim(
  file = "path_to_file.txt",
  delim = "\t",
  na = c("", "NA"),
  trim_ws = TRUE,
  guess_max = 20000
)
This method handles quoted text, trims whitespace, and accommodates large datasets by guessing column types from all rows.

User
Can you give me code to get only the last word of Municipality column?

ChatGPT said
To extract the last word from the Municipality column, you can use the stringr package in R. Here's the code to achieve this:

R
Copy code
# Load the stringr package
library(stringr)

# Extract the last word from the Municipality column
data$municipality_type <- str_extract(data$Municipality, "\\w+$")

# Check the updated dataset
head(data$municipality_type)
Explanation:
str_extract():

Extracts a pattern from the text.
The regular expression \\w+$ matches the last sequence of word characters (\\w+) at the end of the string ($).
data$municipality_type:

Creates a new column with only the last word extracted from the Municipality column.
This will give you a new column like "Town", "City", or "Village". Let me know if you need further assistance!

Give me code to help me save cleaned_data in parquet format
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To save your cleaned data in Parquet format, you can use the arrow package in R. Hereâ€™s the code to save the cleaned data:

Install and Load the arrow Package
R
Copy code
# Install arrow package if not already installed
if (!requireNamespace("arrow", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("arrow")
}

# Load the package
library(arrow)
Save Cleaned Data in Parquet Format
R
Copy code
# Save the cleaned data in Parquet format
write_parquet(data_cleaned, "cleaned_data.parquet")

# Verify the file is saved
list.files(pattern = "\\.parquet$")
Explanation:
write_parquet():

Saves the data_cleaned dataframe as a Parquet file.
The output file, cleaned_data.parquet, will be created in the current working directory.
Verify File:

Use list.files() to ensure the file is saved correctly.
Reading the Parquet File Back
You can read the Parquet file later using arrow:

R
Copy code
# Read the Parquet file
cleaned_data_loaded <- read_parquet("cleaned_data.parquet")

# Check the loaded data
head(cleaned_data_loaded)
Let me know if you encounter any issues!
